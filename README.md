# Enhanced Forum Project

Welcome to the Enhanced Forum project! This project aims to build upon our previous forum creation and take it to the next level by incorporating new features such as private messaging and real-time actions using JavaScript and WebSockets.

## Objectives

In this project, we focused on the following points:

1. Registration and Login
2. Creation of Posts
3. Commenting on Posts
4. Private Messages

## Project Structure

- **SQLite**: Database storage for forum data.
- **Golang**: Backend handling of data and WebSockets.
- **JavaScript**: Frontend event handling and client-side WebSockets.
- **HTML**: Organization of page elements.
- **CSS**: Styling of page elements.

## Single Page Application

We have only one HTML file, and every change of page is handled in JavaScript. This approach ensures a single page application architecture.

## Running the Project

To run the project, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
go run .
